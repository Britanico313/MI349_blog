            <h2>Cancer Rates In Auto Workers</h2>

            <p>In a recent study, researchers delved into the potential health risks associated with exposure to motor
                oils and fumes among workers in the United Auto Workers - General Motors (UAW-GM) cohort as well as
                Valvolines and Jiffy Lubes across the country spanning from 1973 to 2015. The study, which included
                100,000 workers, aimed to assess the incidence of multiple different types of cancer, with a focus on
                digestive, respiratory, and hormonal cancers. My reasoning for the importance of this is because I am an
                auto worker thus we are told we are working with heavily cancerous materials. Furthermore, the study
                revealed elevated risks of stomach and kidney cancers... very scary. These illnesses were associated
                with higher levels of exposure to engine oil on the skin, and an increased incidence of rectal and
                prostate cancer with more exposure to ATF fluid. Additionally, synthetic oil was linked to a higher risk
                of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and prostate cancer. It's worth noting that no associations were found between engine oil and colon or lung related cancers.</p>
            <p>This study struck fear into my brain. Many times I would get off work covered in oil, ATF fluid, brake
            cleaner, and other fluids, and yet I wouldn't always shower right away. I would grab some drinks with
            friends or even travel for extended periods of time. But now I shower practically immediately after
            getting off work. Thus, I found probability data of their findings to look at the higher probability of
            getting these cancers if exposed for long periods of time.</p>

            <h2>First Day Back To Work</h2>

            <p>On my first day back from work, I found myself at an auto-technician shop, but I've decided to keep this
                job a secret for now. My plan is to continue working here until I graduate from university. In this
                shop, I work on various vehicles, handling all makes and models. However, I do have some thoughts on a
                specific automotive company, General Motors, whose part placement and engineering, in my opinion, could
                use some improvement.</p>
            <p>A significant majority of the vehicles I work on happen to be from General Motors (GM). What I've
                observed about many GM vehicles, particularly the Traverse, Terrain, Equinox, Malibu, Impala, Cruz, and
                others that share a common chassis, is their peculiar placement of parts. Specifically, their oil filter
                arrangements are quite unusual. In the case of the Terrain, Equinox, and Malibu, they use what we refer
                to as canister filters -- a rather unconventional design involving a plastic housing instead of the more
                common spin-on filter. This design choice is concerning, especially since oil changes can become quite
                tricky as a result. To add, these plastic filters are exposed to high temperatures and then in the
                winter they get very cold, which can cause the plastic to stiffen and swell, causing cracks that are
                very expensive to fix and transport the vehicle, as it can lead to a leak.</p>
